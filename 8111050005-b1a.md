JCS: An Explainable COVID-19 Diagnosis System byJoint Classification and Segmentation

▸

This paper proposes a new method called Joint

Classification and Segmentation (JCS).

▸

It achieves **pixel-level** annotation of images of

infected individuals.

▸

The method utilizes a large dataset of CT images for

training.

▸

It takes advantage of the features of Convolutional

Neural Networks (CNNs) that are well-suited for

analyzing two-dimensional images.

JCS: An Explainable COVID-19 Diagnosis System byJoint Classification and Segmentation

To train our JCS system,

we construct a large scale COVID-19Classification and Segmentation (COVID-CS)dataset,

with 144,167 chest CT imagesof 400 COVID-19 patients

and 350 uninfected cases. 3,855 chestCT images of 200 patients

are annotated with fine-grainedpixel-levellabels of opacifications

Inf-Net: Automatic COVID-19 Lung InfectionSegmentation from CT Scans

▸

The CT images of patients are divided into two categories: normal and

infected.

▸

The images of infected individuals are annotated (seeded) and fed into

the model to obtain segmentation labels (**pseudo-labels\***).

▸▸

The uninfected images are also fed into the Inf-net model for training.

Considering the urgent situation of COVID-19, it is challenging to

collect a sufficient amount of labeled data for training deep models in a

short period of time.
